# 📊 Data Science Compendium

This repository is my ongoing collection of **data science concepts and code**.  
The idea is simple: keep things organized so that anyone (myself included) can come back later and quickly find an explanation, a piece of code, or a small project to learn from.

Instead of long textbook-style writing, each section here is short, practical, and to the point.  
If you want to know what “variance” means, how to write a simple regression from scratch, or just want to peek at a Jupyter notebook to see an example — that’s what this repo is for.
